# Scavenge Nostalgia

## Overview

This is a fork of the Scavenge and Survive gamemode, created by Southclaws, for a Brazilian community.

The game server has been terminated.

The base version of the fork is unknown.

There are numerous features and bug fixes in the 1300 commits made since the community was formed. Too long of a list for me to go over at this point.
